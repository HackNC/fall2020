                        <h3>Best Hack for Group Living in 2020</h3>
                        <p>
                            Presented by CoStar.<br>
                            2020 is a year like no other. As University students, you stand at the intersection of ‘Stay
                            at Home’ and ‘Live together’. In either case (or both) your community is facing challenges
                            related to each. You have some students who are remote, and some trying to safely live on
                            Campus, but all are members of your community. This challenge is to come up with the best
                            hack related to Group Living in 2020, both virtual and/or in-person. This is an area where
                            you are the experts. CoStar has been extensively involved with apartment living and campus
                            living for many years, and we realize how difficult a situation this is. There are many
                            considerations in this challenge, from community building to public health. Even in a
                            University setting, there are marginalized and vulnerable people, and the isolation has a
                            significant effect on all of us.
